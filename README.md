 My entry for the GameDev.tv Community Game Jam 2020

## About this project
This game is a work in progress, intended for the GameDev.tv's Community Game Jam of May, 2020.

The theme of the game jam is 'Time'.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! Please note: Some of the assets used in this project (see section 'Asset Credits') is free to use, but not owned by me, their individual licences should be complied with. For the remaining assets, they are made by me and is a shared effort between my different studios under Indie Pro Studio.

### How To Build / Compile
This is a Unity project. If you're familiar with source control, then "clone this repo". Otherwise download the contents, and navigate to `Assets > Levels` then open any `.unity` file.

This branch is the work in progress branch, each commit corresponds to a workday. The current state is the latest progress.
